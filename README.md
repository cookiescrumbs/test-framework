# Test and Automation Challenge #

## Task 1: Create an automated API level test scenario ##

Build a script/program (using any language/framework/library you want) that runs tests to assert the top 3 API non-compliant scenarios you found;
Create a Readme file telling us how to run it; and
Commit and push everything to a folder called api-tests on the public repository you've created for the exercise.


## Task 2: Create an automated UI level test scenario ##


## Task 3: Create a CI pipeline
